lab5254@5254:~$ cd NiTE-Linux-x64-2.2/
lab5254@5254:~/NiTE-Linux-x64-2.2$ sudo ./install.sh 


拷贝环境变量到.bashrc中
lab5254@5254:~/NiTE-Linux-x64-2.2$ cat NiTEDevEnvironment >> ~/.bashrc




然后关键的一步，我当时运行UserViewer也是打不开设备，所以才想到这一步的，cd到NiTE-2.0.0/Samples/Bin/下，看到有一个libOpenNI2.so,这是安装包自带的一个当然不行，于是我把OpenNI-Linux-x86-2.2/Redist下的libopenNI.so考过来replace掉原来的那个文件，

在进到NiTE-2.0.0/Samples/Bin/下跑UserViewer时出现了想要的深度图，在前面移动一下还有Tracking的标签。
